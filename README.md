# Climate Change Analysis and Model Comparison

This project aims to explore climate change patterns using real-world datasets and compare various machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions or temperature anomalies. The analysis is performed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `climate_change_(model_comparison).ipynb`: Notebook for training and comparing different ML models (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on climate-related data.
- `climate_change (4).ipynb`: Core notebook for data preprocessing, visualization, and preliminary analysis of climate datasets.

## 🧪 Objective

To analyze the effects of climate change using historical data and evaluate the performance of various machine learning models for predictive insights.

## 📊 Key Features

- Climate data exploration (temperature, CO₂, etc.)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations (trends, correlations)
- ML model training and evaluation (e.g., MSE, R² Score)
- Comparison of models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Others
